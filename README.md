SDAssignment
===========================================================================
This application is a version of the well known game Connect 4.
It was implemented during the course Software Developemnt in University of Edinburgh.
The purpose of the assignment was to take a version of the game that didn't work
properly and propose a new better version.

We had to proceed through many stages

1. Find the problems, errors and inefficiencies of the given code.
2. Propose changes to code, GUI, algorithm etc.
3. Estimate the risks during development.
4. Implement the new version
5. Describe the whole process and mention the changes.

 How to run the game
 =========================================================================
 The game was made using Java and Eclipse. Unfortunately we cannot just import the folder into 
 Eclipse workspace, so we must do some tricks.
 
 1. Download the zip file from Github and unzip it.
 2. Go to unzipped folder, copy the folders images, sounds, src.
 2. Go to Eclipse, create a new Java project i.e. SDAssignment.
 3. Go to Eclipse workspace, paste the folders and replace all existing folders in project
 5. Go to Eclipse and right click on SDAssignment and then refresh.
 6. New folders will appear. we are ready to run the game. no external dependencies or paths needed
 7. Run game as Java application. Because there are 3 main functions, choose the main in runGame.
 8. Enjoy

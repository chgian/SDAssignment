SDAssignment
===========================================================================
This application is a version of the well known game Connect 4.
It was implemented during the course Software Developemnt in University of Edinburgh.
The purpose of the assignment was to take a version of the game that didn't work
properly and propose a new better version.

We had to proceed through many stages

1. Find the problems, errors and inefficiencies of the given code.
2. Propose changes to code, GUI, algorithm etc.
3. Estimate the risks during development.
4. Implement the new version
5. Describe the whole process and mention the changes.

 How to run the game

 The game was made using Java and in Eclipse.
 
 1. Download the zip file from Github and save it to Eclipse workbench.
 2. Go to File->Import->General->Existing Projects into Workspace  and then next.
 3. Select root directory, find the workspace and when the new project appears select it and then Finish.
